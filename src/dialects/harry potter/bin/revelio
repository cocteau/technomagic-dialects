# Revelio
#
# A charm used to reveal hidden objects. It may also be used to
# reveal the true appearance of someone who changed their appearance
# with a spell.
#
# What this charm does when it is cast depends on the object on which
# it was cast. If the object is a directory, the charm reveals hidden
# files within the directory. If the object is a file, the charm will
# reveal additional information about the type of file that it is,
# even if the file's name or extension has been altered; said another
# way, this charm will reveal the true form of the file based on its
# real contents, not its appearance or its name.
