# Book of Spells
#
# The Book of Spells is a spellbook describing the use of a range of
# basic and not-so-basic charms that will enhance, protect, and
# enliven your life.
#
# Book of Spells is more than just a simple textbook, however. The
# book was enchanted by Miranda Goshawk to be capable of projecting
# its text out of the page for simpler reading, as well as conjuring
# various objects, and even entire rooms, to provide a safe
# environment for practising the book's various spells. The book's
# enchantments are such that even doodles and other embellishments
# added by previous owners of a copy of the book would be added to the
# book's contents and could be utilised by future readers of that
# copy.
#
# This program, however, currently only provides a lookup of existing
# spells.
