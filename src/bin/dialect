# This script activates a particular dialect.
#
# Add the directory of this program to your shell's $PATH, then use
# the `source` command to invoke this script. For example:
#
#     source dialect "text based game"
#
# will activate the "text based game" dialect. You can then say stuff
# like "look around" to your shell. Likewise "look around" is defined
# as a command script in the `src/dialects/text based game/bin`
# directory. Simply "look around" "src/dialects/text based game/bin"
# for an idea of what other things are in there.
